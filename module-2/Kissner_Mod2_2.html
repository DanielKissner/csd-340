        <p class="intro">
            My name is Daniel Kissner and I am 34 years old.  I live in the midwest and work as a retail
            associate.  I drive a blue Honda Fit that is 15 years old.  Though it may not look as good
            as it did when it ws new, it gets me from place to place just fine.

            My family consists of my mother, my father, my twin brother and older half brother.  My twin
            brother and I do not look alike as we are fraternal twins, not identical.  The less I say about 
            my older half brother, the better.
        </p>

        <p>
            My hobbies are watching movies, reading, listening to music and playing video games.<span class="sentence">I have way
                too much random information about movies floating around in my brain, and I will absolutely
                unleash it all on any poor soul who shows even the slightest passing interest.</span>  My favorite band is
            the Danish band Mew
        </p>

        <p>
            I love animals, and have a special love for cats.  I used to have a couple of cats of my own, and 
            they were incredible creatures whom I loved very much.  They passed from old age a few years ago, 
            so now I just dote on my parents' cats instead.  I adore them, even if they can be naughty little gremlins
            sometimes.
